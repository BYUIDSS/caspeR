The goal of caspeR is to be used by healthcare facilities that need to scrape the CASPER reports from 2019-Feb 2020. This was built by BYUI students in Winter 2020 to help health care providers clean their monthly pdfs from each of their facilities. This package takes the 
information from the CASPER reports to analyze and put it in a table which is then written to a csv for further analytic use. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of caspeR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("caspeR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
