\title{Builds the scrapped table from the 2020 CASPER reports with two tables}
\usage{
get_2_tables_info_2020(
  text,
  Facility_ID,
  CCN,
  Facility_Name,
  Report_Period,
  Comparision_Group,
  Run_Date,
  City_State,
  Version_Number
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{requires character strings, the raw_text from the CASPER pdf for the
following: Facility_ID, CCN, Facility_Name, Report_Period, Comparision_Group,
Run_Date, City_State, and the Version_Number}

\item{details}{the easiest way to use this function is to use the other functions
mentioned above to get the numbers from the pdf and assign variable names to their
outputs}
}
\value{
returns the all the information from the data table on the CASPER reports as a
   dataframe in R
}
\description{
This function is to be used for the pdf reports from 2020 that have two tables in the
pdf (Jan 2020 reports have one table but Feb 2020 reports have two). If the report being
scrapped has one table see \code{\link{get_1_table_info_2020}}. The arguments for
this function are the same as the outputs for \code{\link{get_table_info_old}} and can be
obtained from the following functions: \code{get_facility_id}, \code{get_CNN}, \code{get_
facility_name}, \code{get_report_period}, \code{get_comparison_group}, \code{get_run_date
}, \code{get_city_and_state},\code{get_version_number}. User should also be aware that
all NA's are represented by the word "null"
}
\examples{
   raw_text <- pdf_text("yourpdf.pdf")
   get_table_info_old(raw_text, "MS0004", "123456", "Name of Facility", "09/01/2019 - 02
   /31/2020", "10/01/2019 - 03/31/2020", "11/03/2019", "Rexburg, ID","3.02")

   raw_text <- pdf_text("yourpdf.pdf")
   Facility_ID <- get_facility_id(raw_text)
   CNN <- get_CNN(raw_text)

   get_table_info_old(raw_text, Facility_ID, CCN, Facility_Name, Report_Period, Comparisio
   n_Group, Run_Date, City_State, Version_Number)
